# Security Policy

## Security Audits

[Trusted CI](https://trustedci.org/) , the NSF Cybersecurity Center of Excellence conducted an in-depth vulnerability assessment of Open OnDemand, completing it in December 2018. This assessment included a careful review of the code, increasing our confidence in its security. The Ohio Supercomputing Center addressed the implementation issues (bugs) that were found during this review, producing a more robust revision of Open OnDemand.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
