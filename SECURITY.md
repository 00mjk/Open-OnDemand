## Reporting a Bug

If you have security concerns or think you have found a vulnerability in Open OnDemand,
please contact us directly via email on the news list found [here](https://lists.osu.edu/mailman/listinfo/ood-users).

Your email will be answered promptly by one of our developers.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a
primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
    released as fast as possible.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a
pull request.
